Q. inside booking should we keep rideid or whole ride object?

Inside the `booking` table, it is **better to keep only the `rideId` (foreign key)** instead of the entire `Ride` object. Here's why:

### ✅ Reasons to Use `rideId` (Foreign Key)
1. **Normalization & Avoid Redundancy**:
   - You don’t want to duplicate the same ride details in multiple places (especially if more than one booking could hypothetically point to the same ride).

2. **Consistency**:
   - If ride details change (e.g., fare, status), updating them in the `ride` table ensures consistency everywhere.

3. **Performance**:
   - Smaller row size in the `booking` table leads to faster queries, especially for write-heavy systems.

4. **Flexibility**:
   - You can fetch full ride details **only when needed** (e.g., in a JOIN query), keeping the booking lightweight.

### ❌ Why Not Store Full Ride Object in `booking`
- **Data duplication**: Each booking would store the same ride data redundantly.
- **Update issues**: Any update to the ride requires changes in all bookings that copied the ride.
- **Storage inefficiency**: More data means more storage, which is unnecessary.

### Conclusion:
Keep only `rideId` in the `booking` table (as shown in your schema). When needed, you can always retrieve the full `ride` details via a JOIN:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM booking b
JOIN ride r ON b.rideId = r.id
WHERE b.id = <some_booking_id>;
```
